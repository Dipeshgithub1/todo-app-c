# todo-app-c
TODO App in C This repository contains a simple HTTP server written in C that responds to client requests with a basic "Hello, World!" HTML page. The server listens on port 8080 and handles HTTP GET requests. This project is primarily for educational purposes to demonstrate how to create a basic HTTP server from scratch in C.
